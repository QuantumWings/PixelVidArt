# PixelVidArt

## Introduction
PixelVidArt is a video conversion platform built using modern web technologies. By sampling and converting each frame in real time, it transforms ordinary videos into unique pointillistic art effects. The platform is designed with a strong emphasis on user experience and performance, presenting every feature in an intuitive manner that allows users to easily master and operate it.

## Main Features
- **Real-Time Video Processing**: Samples and converts each frame of a video to create a pointillistic art effect.
- **Diverse Dot Effects**: Offers various dot shape options (such as circle, square, hexagon, heart, star, and polygon), along with adjustable dot size and brightness threshold.
- **Connection Effects**: Enables a connection feature that, based on user-defined line complexity, thickness, and style, creates rich visual links between dots.
- **Playback Control and Effects**: Allows adjustment of video playback speed and provides neon effects and dynamic particle modes to enhance the visual presentation.
- **Recording and Saving**: Supports multiple resolutions and audio options, enabling users to save the converted video.
- **Intuitive Control Interface**: Features built-in control elements and real-time preview functions, with detailed operating instructions that make it accessible even for beginners.

## Installation and Setup Guide

### System Requirements
- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- A stable internet connection to access Google Fonts and other external resources
- A basic server environment (such as Live Server, Apache, or Nginx for testing and deployment)

### Usage Instructions
1. Clone this project from GitHub to your local environment.
2. Ensure that the above system requirements are met.
3. Open the `index.html` file directly or deploy it on a web server to start using PixelVidArt.

## User Guide

### Operating Steps
1. Open `index.html` to access the main interface of PixelVidArt.
2. Use the "Upload File" button to upload the video file you wish to convert.
3. Adjust the parameters of the pointillistic effect (such as dot shape, size, threshold, connection parameters, playback speed, etc.) using the various sliders and dropdown menus on the control panel.
4. Preview the real-time pointillistic art effect on the screen and fine-tune the settings as needed.
5. Use the recording and saving feature to choose the desired resolution and audio options, then save the converted video locally.

### Example
For example, if you upload a landscape video, you might choose a circular dot effect and adjust the threshold based on the varying light intensities in the video to ensure richer detail in darker areas. Additionally, by enabling the connection feature and adjusting the line complexity and thickness, natural connections are formed between the dots. Combined with a neon effect, this adds a futuristic touch to the overall visual presentation. Once all adjustments are complete, you can save the video in 720p or a higher resolution.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: Contains all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code used to build and display the interactive interface of PixelVidArt.
- **styles.css**: Defines all interface styles to ensure a consistent and visually appealing presentation.
- **script.js**: Implements the core logic for video processing, real-time rendering, control interface interactions, and other front-end functionalities.
- **Other Resources**: Includes all required icons, fonts, and external resource links.
